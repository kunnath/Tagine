# Answer Evaluation App

## Overview

The Answer Evaluation App is a Streamlit-based application that allows users to evaluate and compare student answers against a correct answer using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and sentence embeddings. The app extracts text from uploaded images, computes similarity scores, and provides insights into text differences and frequencies.

## Features

- Upload images containing the correct answer and the student's answer.
- Extract text from images using Tesseract OCR.
- Compare answers using sentence embeddings and compute a similarity score.
- Highlight common and different words between the correct answer and the student's answer.
- Display frequency distributions of words in both answers.
- Explanation of the similarity score and factors affecting it.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later
- Tesseract OCR (make sure it is installed on your system)

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

   chmod +x run.sh

streamlit run app.py


Usage Instructions

	1.	Open the application in your browser as directed by the Streamlit output.
	2.	Upload the image files containing the correct answer and the studentâ€™s answer.
	3.	The app will process the images, extract text, and display a similarity score.
	4.	Review the common and different words, frequency distributions, and the explanation of the similarity score.
